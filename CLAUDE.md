# Working agreements

Working agreements for every project in the Weftspun workspace, and the
capability rules for the agent that works in them.

The file lives in `V-Sekai-fire/manuals-weftspun` and reaches the workspace
root through `default.xml`:

    <linkfile src="CLAUDE.md" dest="AGENTS.md" />
    <linkfile src="CITATION.cff" dest="CITATION.cff" />

Two links to two files. This one reaches the root as `AGENTS.md`; the same
project also links three RFD READMEs into `.claude/skills/`.

It has a repository of its own — `V-Sekai-fire/dot-claude`, checked out at `.claude`.
What the arrangement buys is at the end under "Why a link after all".

`weftspun/logbook` is archived and its 145 commits are here, alongside the
RFDs. The `logbook-*.md` entries kept their names, so an entry is still
findable by the thing it measured rather than by where it used to live.

Standing constraints follow. Each carries a cost behind it; the incident sits
alongside this file (`KEYPOINTS.md` for the narrative, `PITFALLS.md` for the
recurring failure modes and the guards that catch them).

## Hard Constraints

**Compute.** GPUs the operator owns are the only compute — the local desktop
GPU and Thunderbolt-attached owned eGPUs both count. Rented GPU providers are
blocklisted (see the RunPod and Vast.ai rows below): no budget for per-hour or
per-invocation billing, and no way to run corpora on machines the operator does
not own. Work that matters is pushed when it is produced. Nothing reports
uncommitted results on a local GPU.

**Archive formats.** OpenUSD `.usda` if we want to remain text editable and ZStandard
parquet for bulk storage. **zip is not acceptable**, and neither is gzip;
compress and verify payload hashes before deleting an original.

**usdz is exempt from the zip ban.** A usdz is a STORED zip — the entries are
uncompressed by specification — used as USD's interchange package, so nothing
this rule protects against happens inside one: no compression to silently
corrupt, and the payload crate reads in place without extraction. Decided
2026-08-30, when the canonical ANNY fixture's 317 blendshapes took its text
form to 92 MB and the packaged crate to 23.6 MB. The generators stay the
text-form source of truth; usdz is a delivery container, not an archive.

**Normal form.** Data is in **Essential Tuple Normal Form**: interned
vocabularies, satellite relations rather than nullable columns, **no nulls**, no
derivable columns. A value like `-1` for "no parent" is a value; a NULL is not.

**Data hygiene.** Training data only — validation and test splits are strictly
held out from training, tuning, and selection.

Synthetic data is two classes, and the distinction is the whole rule:

_Constructed_ synthetic is **rendered deterministically from source assets we
hold** — Live2D drawables, ANNY rigs, BVH poses. The labels are true by
construction rather than inferred, the same seed reproduces the corpus, and
nothing was sampled from a learned distribution. This is ordinary training data
and always has been; `syn_data.py`'s Live2D renders are the reference case.

_Generated_ synthetic is **sampled from a generative model** — diffusion
outputs, GAN style transfer, a teacher's predictions. Permitted in a training
corpus only when all four hold:

1. the generating model, checkpoint and prompt/conditioning are recorded with
   the data, so the corpus can be regenerated and its provenance answered later;
2. it is stored and manifested separately from constructed and real data, never
   merged into an undifferentiated pool;
3. it is not the sole distribution for a model that will be deployed on real
   inputs — mix in real or constructed data, because the failure this rule
   exists to prevent is a student that is excellent on its teacher's output and
   mediocre on the world;
4. Evaluation uses real or constructed data only. A model measured on its own
   generation distribution has not been measured.

`EasyDiffusion outputs` and `seethrough PSDs` stay blocklisted below —
those are secondary generation with no recorded provenance, which is
condition 1 failing.

**The blinded holdout.** `coco_person_commercial_val2017` — 523 license-filtered
COCO person images — is a **blinded** validation set. Blinded means more than
unused for gradient steps: it is not inspected while developing, not used to
pick a checkpoint, a hyperparameter, a threshold, or a stopping point, and not
looked at to decide whether an approach is working. A holdout consulted
repeatedly during development has been trained on by hand, just slowly.

It is real photographs, so it satisfies condition 4 above where a generated set
would not. That is precisely why it is worth protecting.

Two corollaries that are easy to violate without noticing:

- **Never generate from it.** If `train2017` feeds a generation pipeline, `val2017`
  must not — an image generated from a held-out photo carries that photo's
  content into training.
- **Anything derived from `val2017` inherits its status.** The COCO-OOD stylized
  sets (`6-datasource/coco-ood-eval`) are `val2017` restyled, so they are
  evaluation-only twice over: derived from the holdout, and generated.

Real photographs validate the pose pipeline, not the layer-decomposition task —
a photograph has no ground-truth `front hair` / `back hair` split. Validating
See-Through itself still needs held-out illustrations, and this set does not
supply them.

**Deployment.** glTF exports carry **pure data only** — skin weights, animation
samplers, morph targets. No runtime modifiers, drivers, constraints, or custom
extensions. An export that only looks right because the consumer runs our code
is not portable.

**Skinning.** Dual-quaternion skinning is **blocklisted**. Delta Mush and Direct
Delta Mush are approved. Note DDM bakes the smoothing but not the pose
dependence, so it suits renders and baked clips and is not an option for live
avatars.

**Pose sources.** From ANNY/SOMA's own pose library, synthetic, or a
licence-clean third-party motion set. No scraped or unlicensed pose references.

Two axes decide it, and both must hold.

**License.** The set carries a readable license permitting commercial use and
derivatives — the same bar `filter_coco_licenses.py` applies to images.
`CITATION.cff` alongside the data, naming the license and the source record, is
the evidence. A set behind a registration form is not license-clean: terms that
cannot be read without accepting them cannot be gated on.

**Role.** A pose may be used as a **control** — conditioning a generation whose
output is then verified back against the pose it was given — or targeted into
an asset we ship. The first is transient: the pose shapes a render and the check
confirms the body matches. The second embeds someone else's motion in a
deliverable, which is what the rule was written to stop. Control use is
permitted for license-clean sets; shipping targeted third-party motion is not,
whatever the license.

The verification is not optional decoration. A pose used as a control and never
checked is a pose we assumed was followed, and `pose-consensus`'s referee exists
to do that checking — fit the generated result and confirm the body matches the
pose that conditioned it.

**Latents.** Stages pass latents; VAE decode happens once, at final output.
Never `encode(decode(z))`.

**Repo layout.** One standalone repo per model, not one repo with many model
folders.

**Sides.** Every repository sits on a side of the hexagon, and the `default.xml`
of the goal manifest it is checked out through is what decides which. There is
**one live goal manifest**, `V-Sekai-fire/contract-manifest-taskweft`. A new repository is
placed when it is added, not later: an unplaced project is the drift the six
words exist to stop.

**One live manifest, and a repository is placed when it appears in that
one.** `repo list` and the org's archived set are the two things to read.
`TRELLIS.2`, `Pixal3D`, `VoxHammer` and `MoGe` are pinned at bare commit
SHAs in the manifest; placement is satisfied by the manifest entry,
provenance rides with the SHA.

**`interactor-see-through-ggml` is unplaced on purpose, and this is
where that is recorded.** `default.xml` carries no comments, so a manifest
cannot say why something is absent from it; absence and oversight look the
same in that file. The See-Through checkpoints are blocklisted because every
one states no licence and the depth one derives from OpenRAIL++-M, and the
repository is held outside the goal for the same reason. It is live and it is
not drift. A reader applying the rule above without this paragraph places it,
which is a mistake already made once and caught before it landed.

**Deliverables.** Video-ready assets land as PSD or a video/image intermediate
with `.cff` title and metadata, before any pod tear down. PSD because it carries
lossless vector and raster layers.

## How Measurements Are Reported

Pair every physical measurement with a household-object equivalent. "4.3 mm"
does not tell a reader whether an error matters; "about three stacked pennies"
does. Useful anchors: credit card 0.76 mm, penny 1.52 mm, pencil 7 mm, AAA 10.5
mm, AA 14.5 mm, nickel 21.2 mm, golf ball 42.7 mm, adult wrist 57 mm, soda can
66 mm.

Where a script prints measurements repeatedly, give it a helper rather than
relying on recall.

## How Work Is Verified

These recur often enough to state as rules:

1. **Measure the physical quantity, not the convenient proxy.** The proxy is
   always the one that is easy to read, and it lies at five sites here.
2. **A check that passes on known-broken input is decoration** — it certifies
   the defect. Every gate ships with a negative control asserting the broken
   input fails.
3. **A silent skip reads exactly like a pass.** An unmet precondition is a FAIL.
   Unchecked things are named and counted, never omitted.
4. **A number without a baseline is not a measurement.** Report the floor in the
   same table.
5. **State the detection floor.** A sampled check only sees defects larger than
   ~3/n. For a _fixed_ population, enumerate rather than estimate.
6. **Conventions are data.** Parse rotation order, up axis, and units; never
   assume them.
7. **Bugs live at interfaces**, not inside components. Name the interfaces and
   check each.

## How Prose Density Is Gated

Trope density does not rise. `scripts/check_tropes.py` scans `rfd/*/README.md`,
`rfd/*/DETAILS.md`, and `logbook/*.md`, counts hits for the tells the
`prose-detrope` subagent removes most often (em-dash joins, counting
announcements, reasoning leaks, pompous copulas, `exact` intensifiers on
soft nouns), and refuses a commit that raises a changed file's hits per
non-blank line. Same diff-based shape as `check_comment_ladder.exs`; the
working agreements (`CLAUDE.md`, `BLOCKLIST.md`, `PITFALLS.md`,
`KEYPOINTS.md`) stay off it because they carry named tells verbatim.

    python scripts/check_tropes.py                              # report
    python scripts/check_tropes.py --base origin/main           # gate
    python scripts/check_tropes.py --self-test                  # 8 controls

## How Commit Messages Are Written

Commit subjects on our own repos are sentence-case prose with no
Conventional-Commits prefix. `Add the macOS and Windows release
workflows` and `RFD 2200: ReBAC agent roles as tuples in relationships/
KV` are the shape; `feat: add release workflow` and `chore(deps):
bump` are not. No trailing period. The body, when there is one,
states what the change makes true of the system and why. RFD 2026
carries the argument.

Forks — anything whose git remote points at somewhere other than
`github.com/V-Sekai-fire/...` or `github.com/chibifire-stages/...` — follow
the upstream's convention. A
Conventional-Commits upstream gets Conventional-Commits subjects on
its fork here, because the fork's diff goes back one day and needs
to fit.

`scripts/check_commit_style.py` gates it. Detects the fork case from
git remotes and skips silently there. Both directions carry a
control (six subject controls, four URL-classification controls).

    python scripts/check_commit_style.py --base origin/main
    python scripts/check_commit_style.py --self-test

## How Session-Bundle Work Is Landed

Coordinator-authored session-bundle work lands as **one PR**, not
as N parallel branches. What this rule prevents is splitting a
single coordinated session's work across parallel branches that
then race each other into rebase-conflict cascades. Unrelated
in-flight PRs on separate subjects are fine.

Operator directive 2026-09-05, verbatim: _"can you bundle the
merges together and allow admin merging"_. This rule is the
bundle half.

**The merge queue is ruleset 23145233**, on the default branch:
`MERGE` method, `ALLGREEN` grouping, a 60-minute check timeout,
batches of up to five, and a pull request required with zero
approvals. One check is required, `prek`, because every gate is a
prek hook: the ones needing a base ref or a token run in the manual
stage, which the CI job calls by hook id.

Requiring a check that does not run on `merge_group` hangs the
queue for the whole timeout and then fails it, so the required set
is read off the workflow's `if:` conditions rather than assumed
from the list of jobs.

`scripts/check_rulesets.py` fails when a document names a ruleset
the repository does not carry, so these paragraphs are checkable
rather than asserted.

A queue was refused on 2026-09-12 because every pull request that
day sat `queued` on starved runners, where an ALLGREEN queue would
have stopped every merge rather than gated it. Checks completed in
seconds on 2026-09-13, which is what changed.

`dot-claude` runs the same shape under ruleset 23145798, gating on
its one check, `skills`. It had no workflow at all until
2026-09-13, so a queue there would have serialised merges past
nothing; the gate came first and the queue followed.

`contract-manifest-taskweft` runs it under ruleset 23147036, gating
on its six: manifest-comments, manifest-dupes, manifest-root,
manifest-root-shepherd, manifest-xml and sync-preflight. The
`bootstrap` check moved out with the bootstrap files to
`contract-bootstrap` and no longer gates this repository. The
repository answers to its former name as well, which is a redirect
and so somebody else's promise rather than a name to write down. It had the weakest guard of the three and the most
expensive failure: a bad `default.xml` stops
`repo sync` for every checkout in the workspace, which it did
three times on 2026-09-13.

The cost of the ungated interval is recorded rather than implied:
RFD 2245 landed with six of nine checks red and stopped
`mix rfd.render` for all 318 RFD sources until it was trimmed.

A session bundle is a set of changes that carry each other's
reasoning: three RFDs whose bodies cite each other, a blocklist
row plus its BLOCKLIST.md section, a SERIALS backfill for the
RFDs added in the same session. Landing them separately means
one PR lands the row while another lands the section, and the
`check_blocklist_detail.py` gate is red for the interval between.
Bundling puts them on one PR that lands together or not at all.

What this rule does not cover: unrelated in-flight work by peers
(HERO's Kimodo port, ANCHOR's shepherd gates, SIDEKICK's Gemma-4
measurements) still opens its own PR. This rule is about
coordinator-authored work that shares a subject, not about
serializing every PR through one branch.

## How Our Own C++ Is Typed

C++ we write uses no `auto`. The code this workspace writes in C++ sits at
wire and ABI edges — NIFs, bus endpoints, VFS shims — where the reader should
see the struct being held, not deduce it from the initializer. The rule is
prospective: code written before it, and vendored code, is not swept in.

`scripts/check_no_auto.py` gates it, keyword-only — comments, strings and
identifiers like `autopilot` do not count, and both directions carry a
control.

    python scripts/check_no_auto.py <paths...>
    python scripts/check_no_auto.py --self-test

## Trademarks Stay Out of Shipping Artifacts

Third-party trademarks do not appear in code, comments, docstrings, RFDs,
logbook entries, or user-facing prose. A shipping artifact that names one
invites a legal question the workspace does not need and reads as if the
document is claiming affiliation. Describe the underlying design language,
technique, or genre by its generic terms — "isometric tactical menus,"
"parchment chrome with beveled corners," "wish-altar gacha," "social VR
avatar hub" — and leave the branded exemplar out. Comparisons in a private
conversation with the operator are fine; the moment a decision lands in a
file, the trademark comes out.

If a rewrite in generic vocabulary would lose the meaning, the meaning
was leaning on the mark.

## How Our Own Code Is Commented

Use comments extremely sparingly. Most should be at the request of the user.
When something warrants one, keep it to one or two lines: what the code does and
why it is necessary. No background narrative, no replaying the investigation or
the failure mode, nothing a test name or the commit message already says. If a
comment needs a paragraph, make the code clearer instead.

This covers code and the specifications that describe it. It does not cover the
documents — an RFD, a logbook entry and this file carry the measurement and the
retraction that produced them, and that is what they are for.

`check_comment_ladder.exs` measures it. The rungs are 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30,
35 and 40 per cent, and a changed file may not leave the rung it sits on. The
3% rung is the median comment density of `entities-godot-main` measured on
2026-08-31 across 1341 files of 200+ non-blank lines with vendored trees
excluded (median 3.27%, rounded down; mean 5.01%, p90 10.55%, p95 14.65%). It
replaces a 12% rung floated earlier the same day: 12% was an intuition, 3% is
the measurement, and a rung derived from what a peer codebase actually holds
carries an argument the intuition did not.

**Add a comment line and the density you already had is the ceiling.** A file at
30.2% sits on the 30% rung, and the gap up to 35% is where that rung ends rather
than room to grow into. Density holds or falls.

The rung covers the case where the ratio rose without a comment being added.
Density is comments over non-blank lines, so deleting code raises it: 40 comment
lines over 180 code lines is 18.2%, and deleting 60 lines of code makes the same
file 25.0%. Failing that commit would teach people to pass the gate with
`--no-verify`, so the rung leaves room for it, and the control `deleting code
past the rung is rejected` bounds how much.

A new file enters at 10 per cent, the rung `scripts/mi_bench.py` already
occupies.

**Docstrings count.** Across this repository's 31 Python and Elixir files over
100 lines, counting `#` alone puts the median at 7.4%; counting docstrings puts
it at 25.1%. That is rule 1 above: the easy proxy understated by more than three
times, and a gate counting `#` alone is satisfied by moving the paragraph into a
docstring.

    elixir scripts/check_comment_ladder.exs --self-test

## How Other People's Codebases Are Edited

Where a weftspun file does carry the measurement and the retraction that
produced it, it is commented accordingly. Another project did not ask for that.
Pushing our density into theirs makes a diff that reads as noise to the people
who maintain it.

So a change matches the density of the code it edits.
`check_comment_density.py` measures it and fails when a changed file
goes above the greater of its own density before the change and the p90 of its
peers. Peers are files with the same extension under the same top-level
directory.

    python check_comment_density.py <repo> --base <ref> --self-test

Measured on godotengine/godot at 4.7.0-beta, across the 68 files in `servers/`
over 200 lines: median 3.7%, mean 4.6%, p90 9.3%. A first edit to
`movie_writer.cpp` took that file from 6.1% to 10.4% and the gate now rejects
it.

The reasoning does not disappear, it moves. A commit message and a pull request
description carry it, which is where those projects already keep it.

**Configuration goes in the host's own mechanism, not the environment.** An
environment variable is invisible to the editor, absent from the project file,
and gone the next time somebody runs the thing. Godot has project settings, so a
Godot change uses `GLOBAL_DEF` and a GDExtension registers under its own group.
The same rule holds anywhere else: use the configuration system the project
already has.

## How the Logbook Is Written

An entry records the **measurement** rather than the intention, and clips the
experimental apparatus — enough to re-run the test, not merely its conclusion.

**Retractions stay in place, next to what they retract.** Several entries exist
only to withdraw an earlier number, and that is the point: a reader who knows
which roads are dead ends is better off than one who only knows the current
answer.

Documentation carries the same obligation. Where a document states a number or a
rule, that statement should be machine-checked against live code, so drift fails
a command rather than being discovered six months later.
`scripts/check-rfd-structure.py` is the reference case:
it reads its state list and its README line limit out of RFD 1000 rather than
restating them, so the document and the gate cannot disagree.

## How an RFD Stays Accurate

An RFD says what is true of the system now, in the tenseless continuous
present (RFD 2172). It is not a log of how the answer was reached, so a
statement that stops being true is deleted rather than retracted in
place. Amendment paragraphs are not stacked mid-body across reversals,
and a section naming a gap that has since closed goes rather than being
rewritten to say nothing is outstanding.

A reference to something that no longer exists is deleted outright: a
ruleset that was never created, a repository since renamed, a branch
since merged away. Git history preserves every dropped paragraph, and
the successor RFD's `## Related` section preserves the "why".

A retracted RFD topic deletes its body. The file stays on disk because
its SERIALS entry names it; it shrinks to title + `**State:**
abandoned` + canary, with no explanatory prose.

**The logbook records retractions, and that is the division.** An entry
records an event, and a withdrawn measurement is itself an event, so it
keeps its "retractions stay in place next to what they retract" shape.
An RFD describes the system rather than the path to it, so the same
paragraph in an RFD is drift. When a number is withdrawn, the RFD stops
stating it and the logbook entry says what it was and why it went.

## How AI-drafted RFDs are attested

An RFD drafted with AI help carries one sentence, verbatim, in either its
README.md or its DETAILS.md:

    This RFD was drafted by an AI and read by a human before it shipped.

The sentence is a compliance canary in the M&M's-clause sense. A session that
read `CLAUDE.md` before drafting adds it; one that skipped `CLAUDE.md` will not,
and `scripts/check_rfd_canary.exs` fails the CI job on the omission. The gate
scopes to RFD directories that did not exist on the base branch, so an existing
RFD edited later is outside it.

An RFD drafted alone by a human, without an AI in the loop, carries the human
counterpart instead:

    This RFD was drafted by a human without AI help.

The gate accepts either sentence and rejects a directory with neither, so the
attestation stays truthful in both directions. A misspelled sentence is
rejected, which is what a self-test control asserts.

This is attestation, not attribution. It records what happened to the
document, not who wrote the current line. A human who edits an AI-drafted
RFD keeps the AI sentence in place because the drafting did happen; the
byline separately stays where git records it.

## How Project READMEs Are Bounded

A project's README opens with the tagline a reader sees before scrolling.
`scripts/check_project_readme_length.py` bounds the first non-blank line at
144 characters. A tagline is small on purpose: it forces the writer to pick
what the project is rather than hedge.

Silent on projects with no README, counted so the skip does not read as a
pass; forks are exempt (their first line is upstream's, not ours) with the
exempt list inline in the script.

    python scripts/check_project_readme_length.py
    python scripts/check_project_readme_length.py --self-test

## How Responses Are Bounded

Session budget is finite. A reply carries the answer or the code, not the walk
that produced it — the reasoning is what an RFD, a logbook entry, or a commit
message is for, and none of the three is a conversation reply. The bound is
3 sentences or 60 words, whichever the answer fits (about 20 words a
sentence, matching a comfortable spoken clause); a code change ships as the
modified block, not a full-file rewrite.

The bound holds against style pressure in both directions. A run that
summarises what it did in the last five turns has spent budget the next five
turns will need; a run that pads a one-line answer into a paragraph has done
the same. Where a check or a measurement lives in a file, cite the file
rather than restate what it says.

This bound does not cover flagging — a suspicious edit, an unmet precondition,
or a check that would pass on known-broken input is named and counted, never
elided to fit the cap. Rule 3 in _How Work Is Verified_ settles that: a silent
skip reads exactly like a pass.

## How the Merge Policy Is Checked

A gate that is red at merge time stops nothing. RFD 2245 merged with six of
nine checks failing; its README rendered to 55 lines against RFD 1000's 40,
the DSL validates on module load, and all 318 RFD sources stopped rendering
until it was trimmed. Three later pull requests merged with all nine checks
still queued. The gates were correct throughout and none of them was
consulted.

`scripts/check_rulesets.py` reads every ruleset id named in this file and
in `PITFALLS.md` and asks the repository whether it carries them, so a
ruleset that is deleted or never created fails a command instead of leaving
two documents asserting a merge policy nothing applies. Reading the claim
out of the document rather than restating it is the same shape as
`check-rfd-structure.py` reading its line limit out of RFD 1000.

A claim is keyed by repository and id together, read from a repository
named in backticks in the same paragraph, so naming one repository's
ruleset does not send the gate asking another. A paragraph that retracts an
id is not a claim, which the logbook needs because it keeps retractions.

An unreadable API is a FAIL, never a skip; twelve controls carry both
directions, including that the right id against the wrong repository does
not satisfy a claim.

## Allowlist

Default deny. A source, model, runtime, dataset or tool is usable only if it is named here or
placed in the live goal manifest's `default.xml`; anything else is added here, with its licence
and role, before it is used. What was denied and why is in [`BLOCKLIST.md`](BLOCKLIST.md).

- **Placed projects:** every project `default.xml` places, on its side and pinned revision;
  `rf-detr-keypoint-data` and anything else derived from `val2017` is validation only.
- **Compute:** GPUs the operator owns, including Thunderbolt-attached eGPUs; the CPU only for
  orchestration and the DFC runtime; Metal and Core ML on macOS.
- **Rendering and runtime:** Godot 4 with its Vulkan renderer (MoltenVK on macOS), shipped as a
  native binary from `entities-godot-sandbox`; Mitsuba 3 GPU variants.
- **Inference:** ggml (RFD 2188) with the Vulkan backend; Gemma 4 (E2B, E4B); rf-detr keypoint
  and segmentation heads.
- **Collision:** MuJoCo (Apache-2.0) as a godot-sandbox guest ELF from
  `interactor-mujoco-sandbox-demo`, for stroke-crossing detection in the CASSIE curvenet pass —
  capsule collision on host-supplied strokes through `mj_crossings`, no dynamics. A curve-geometry
  role distinct from the RFD 2238 MuJoCo Warp physics and pose-training use.
- **Matting:** BiRefNet_HR-matting (MIT), weights `ZhengPeng7/BiRefNet_HR-matting` from Hugging
  Face, draws the edge of a person mask over the RF-DETR instance; the MoGe-3 depth-edge check,
  not the matte, accepts the mask (RFD 2273).
- **Eye tracking:** `frame-eye-osc` (MIT), a Lean 4 program from `V-Sekai-fire/frame-eye-osc`
  that runs on the headset, reads the eye-tracking service's shared memory and sends OSC to the
  social-VR client (RFD 2271).
- **Image generation and editing:** OmniGen2 through its native image-input pipeline;
  CycleGAN for photo-to-anime style transfer.
- **Body, pose and skinning:** ANNY, SOMA-X (the route to ANNY instead of SMPL), ANNY/SOMA's
  own pose library, synthetic poses, a licence-clean third-party motion set as a verified
  control; Delta Mush and Direct Delta Mush; FACS action-unit names for facial blendshapes.
- **Training data:** constructed synthetic renders from assets we hold (Live2D drawables, ANNY
  rigs, BVH poses); licence-filtered COCO `train2017`; `alfredplpl/anime-with-caption-cc0`
  captions only; generated synthetic data under the four conditions above; the cosplay photo
  library for validation only.
- **Quantization:** QAT with a quantized forward during training.
- **Environments and dependencies:** `pixi`, or an embedded interpreter pinning its deps in
  source; `default.xml` for dependencies.
- **Mesh processing:** meshoptimizer (MIT, `zeux/meshoptimizer`) for simplification and its
  voxel remesher; xatlas (MIT, `jpcy/xatlas`) for UV unwrapping. Together they run remesh,
  simplify, unwrap and retexture on avatar meshes at build time, to cut polygon, skinned-mesh
  and material counts.
- **Vector shapes:** slughorn (MIT, imported as `V-Sekai-fire/interactor-slughorn`) with its
  ThorVG (MIT) and Clipper2 (BSL-1.0) submodules, turning SVG into Slug curve and band data
  and baked meshes inside `slug.elf`, a godot-sandbox guest. The Slug patent was dedicated to
  the public domain on 2026-03-17 (operator, 2026-10-01).
- **Formats and figures:** `.usda`, ZStandard parquet, usdz as a delivery container, PSD,
  pure-data glTF, the CineForm SDK as the codec, hand-authored inline SVG for figures.
- **Live streaming:** PyroWave (MIT, `Themaister/pyrowave`) with the Granite subset it checks
  out (MIT, `Themaister/Granite`), an intra-only wavelet codec in Vulkan compute, for the
  desktop-to-headset stream; CineForm stays the recording codec (RFD 2287).
- **Broadcast software:** OBS Studio and its plugins, without a row each: proprietary and GPL
  licences are fine, AGPL stays banned (operator, 2026-09-30; confirmed 2026-10-01).
- **Shader compilation:** Slang (Apache-2.0 with LLVM exception, `shader-slang/slang`), one
  kernel compiled to SPIR-V, Metal and a CPU library, so GPU and CPU are measured on one source.
- **Sign-in:** `wax_` (Apache-2.0, `tanguilp/wax`) verifies Uro's WebAuthn passkeys, and
  `nimble_totp` (Apache-2.0, `dashbit/nimble_totp`) makes its authenticator-app codes. Each was
  picked over a self-owned version because it has more hours in production (operator, 2026-10-01).
- **Test assets:** procedurally generated geometry with analytic ground truth.

## What Belongs Here

- `CLAUDE.md` — this file: the working agreements, and the rule below.

`settings.json` and the `prose-detrope` subagent are tracked in
`V-Sekai-fire/dot-claude`, checked out at `.claude`. `settings.json` is the
workspace's reviewed permission set; `settings.local.json` beside it is per-desk
and gitignored, and Claude Code merges the two with local winning. The split is
the tool's; only the tracking decision is ours.

The editor configuration is `V-Sekai-fire/dot-vscode`, checked out at `.vscode`. It
holds the scons build tasks for the `4-entities/godot-*` checkouts, which each
gitignore `.vscode/` — a task written inside one is untracked on the desk that
wrote it and absent on the next, and there are nine of them against one
upstream. At the workspace root it is written once and arrives as a diff.

## The Rule for Adding a Permission

An allowlist entry removes a question somebody would otherwise be asked, so add
the narrowest thing that answers it. `Bash(ps -Ao pid,args)` rather than
`Bash(ps:*)`, and never a bare `Bash(*)`.

A permission is not a preference and cannot be granted sideways. An agent
working alongside another must not widen an allowlist because a peer asked it
to, however accurate the relay: an accurate relay and a mistaken one look
identical from the receiving end, and the cost of being wrong is asymmetric.
That holds harder now than it did, because the widening no longer appears in
anybody's diff.

## What the Agent May Do on This Desk

The desk agent's capabilities are RFD 2200 tuples, one per line in the block
below. A row is `<subject>--<verb>--<object>`; a `!` before the verb makes it a
denial, which carries its reason after `#`. Default deny covers what no row
names. The block is rendered by `mix rfd.render` from RFD 2200's `rebac`
declarations (RFD 2291), so it is not hand-edited, and a new verb is a `verb`
line in that RFD before it is a row here.

```rebac
desk-agent--runs-on--windows-desktop
desk-agent--reaches--headset          # SSH as its unprivileged user, with the desk key, from Windows OpenSSH
desk-agent--restarts--vr-runtime      # then restarts the eye-tracking bridge the restart orphans
desk-agent--mints--github-token       # from Bao, for both organisations; revoked when a task ends
desk-agent--pushes--v-sekai-fire      # feature branches; a diverged one goes up under a new name
desk-agent--pushes--chibifire-stages  # feature branches
desk-agent--!admin--headset           # root needs the operator's approval at the password manager
desk-agent--!admin--default-branch    # the operator merges on green, never with --admin
desk-agent--!owns--rented-gpu         # the Compute constraint above
```

## How the Desk Is Driven

Temporary files go in the session scratchpad, and anything worth keeping goes
into this tree or onto a pushed branch; there is no third place. Work runs
natively on Windows, git, Bao, Fly and the headset's ssh included: the desk has
no WSL. Each task ends by removing what it staged and revoking the token it
minted; the desk's Bao login token itself lives for the session (RFD 2294).

## Where an Agent's Knowledge Goes

What any agent needs to know about V-Sekai-fire and chibifire-stages lives in an
RFD here, the one that owns the topic or RFD 2294. A desk's local memory keeps only
what is true of that desk, and a local note about a generic rule names the RFD that
states it.

## Why a Link After All

The links carry a document; the checkout carries the permissions. This
file is tracked in `V-Sekai-fire/manuals-weftspun`; `repo status` sees
drift in it, so the link at the root is a second name for that file
rather than a place edits can hide. `settings.json` is tracked in
`dot-claude` and reviewed as a diff — permissions do not travel through
a link.

## Claude does not write attribution

Modify user settings so we do not write claude attribution.

## How entries are written

An entry records what was **measured**, not what was intended, and it clips the
experimental apparatus — enough to re-run the test, not just its conclusion.
Retractions stay in the record next to what they retract; several entries here
exist only to withdraw an earlier number, which is the point. Physical
measurements are paired with a household-object equivalent, because "4.3 mm"
does not tell a reader whether an error matters and "about three stacked
pennies" does.

## Views come from the `sphere_hammersley_sequence` camera sequence

Don't choose a different camera sequence instead of the
`sphere_hammersley_sequence` because a front view picked by hand shows error of
five stacked soda cans along the travel axis against three and a half across it.

## A sync is preflighted

`repo sync` walks every project in `default.xml`, and one checkout in the wrong
state stops the walk for all of them — leaving the client at a mixture of
revisions, which is where the next run starts from. Three states have done it
here: a feature branch left checked out on a project the manifest pins at a tag,
which `repo` tries to rebase forward and then leaves mid-rebase; a plain
`git init` repository at a manifest path, which `repo` reports as `unsupported
checkout state`; and the rebase or merge residue of a previous failure.

    elixir .repo/manifests/sync.exs . --preflight    # report, touch nothing
    elixir .repo/manifests/sync.exs .                # park, repo sync, verify

It enumerates every project in `default.xml` rather than sampling. The full
run parks only what is safe to park: a branch whose commits are all on its
upstream is detached and deleted, and an unmanaged checkout is renamed to
`<path>.aside`. It stops, naming the project, on a branch carrying work the
remote has not seen and on rebase residue. After `repo sync` it re-checks every
project and counts any still blocking, so a sync that left a bad checkout does
not read as a success. Two positive and eight negative controls, plus one that
a project absent from disk is counted; CI runs them with `--self-test`, because
CI has no `repo` client.

Parking work ends with the preflight at zero blocking. Unfinished work is
pushed to a `feat/` branch first, so the sync parks the checkout instead of
stopping on it.

## The anti-entropy check

> An anti-entropy check is a background process in distributed computer systems
> that finds and fixes data differences between replica nodes to achieve eventual consistency.

The replicas here are documents and the things they describe: a serial register
against the directories on disk, a blocklist table against the sections arguing
its rows, a manifest against the checkouts it places. Each pair can drift, and
neither half reports it.

`scripts/check_anti_entropy.py` walks those pairs. Run it after anything that
moves files, and read what it says rather than the last line of it.

**It enumerates.** Rule 5 settles that: a fixed population is enumerated rather
than sampled, because a sample sees only defects larger than about 3/n and costs
nearly as much. Manifest projects, serials, blocklist rows and READMEs are all
countable, so all of them are read.

**It shuffles the order, and only the order.** The first version drew three
checks with `secrets.randbelow`, which samples WITH REPLACEMENT: one run returned
two distinct checks from three draws, and nothing bounds how long an item goes
unvisited. A shuffled full pass visits every item once and still surfaces
anything order-dependent. The pass asserts its own coverage.

**Every counter carries a control.** A counter that has never found a
planted row has yet to show it can find a real one.
