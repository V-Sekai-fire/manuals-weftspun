  scope "the joy forecast on each feature and the sense-of-wonder rubric."

  prose ~S"""
  :: hook
  Each feature carries a joy forecast, so the plan shows where players are expected to find joy.
  :: intrigue
  Infrastructure a player never notices rates low however necessary it is. The forecasts say
  where joy is expected, not what is worth building.
  :: exit
  Give a new feature a forecast in RFD66606-2295's tag form, rated on the five criteria, and
  compare it with the dev.1 table.
  :: decision
  Each feature carries a forecast, in RFD66606-2295's tag form, of the chance
  that a player finds joy in it, judged on a sense-of-wonder rubric of
  five criteria: a new sense (an experience new technology makes
  possible), a new standard (it changes how a player sees games),
  emergence (AI or other people make it come alive), motivation (seeing
  it makes someone want to play) and surprise.
  :: related
  - RFD66606-2293, where this rule lived before the split.
  - RFD66606-2295, the tag form of the forecasts.
  - RFD66606-2296 carries dev.2's forecasts and RFD66606-2298 dev.next's.
