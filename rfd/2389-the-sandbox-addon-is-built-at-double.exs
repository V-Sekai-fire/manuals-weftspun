  :: hook
  The sandbox addon is built at double from a pinned commit and recorded in CITATION.cff.
  :: intrigue
  Which double binaries can be trusted when some in taskweft-godot-sandbox are unrecorded?
  :: exit
  Check the addon's commit, flags and sha256 in `CITATION.cff` against the build command in
  RFD66606-2389.
  :: decision
  The addon at double is built from &{repo("entities-godot-sandbox", planned: "4-entities")} at
  `b1118e` plus its binary-translation emitter, by `addon.yml` in the same workflows' home. It is
  released on a tag and vendored into `addons/godot_sandbox/bin` under the names the
  `.gdextension` already maps, with commit, flags and sha256 in `CITATION.cff`.
