  :: hook
  A guest's source lives in the repository that consumes it, split the way curvenet splits it.
  :: intrigue
  A vmcall takes at most seven arguments, an eighth failing with a register overflow.
  :: exit
  Check a new guest against the rule: `main.cpp` marshals and sees only `api.hpp`, and
  `*_api.cpp` sees the library.
  :: decision
  - A guest's source lives in the repository that consumes it and follows curvenet's split:
    `main.cpp` marshals and sees only `api.hpp`, and `*_api.cpp` sees the library.
  - Mesh arrays cross in the layout of &{repo("contract-guest-common")}'s `mesh_wire.h`.
  - A vmcall takes at most seven arguments, an eighth failing with a register overflow, and each
    call returns inside the sandbox's `execution_timeout`.
