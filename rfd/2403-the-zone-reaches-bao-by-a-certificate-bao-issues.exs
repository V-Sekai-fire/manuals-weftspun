  prose ~S"""
  :: hook
  The zone reaches Bao by a client certificate that Bao itself issues.
  :: intrigue
  Every GitHub step needs a Bao tailnet node online, because the desk's own `gh` is an hourly
  installation token minted through Bao.
  :: exit
  Run `tailscale status` before a GitHub step to see whether a Bao tailnet node is online.
  :: decision
  - The worker and the server reach Bao over the private network at `weftspun-bao.internal:8200`
    with a client certificate from a new cert-auth role `zone-fly` whose policy is
    `sqlite-fdb/exec/zone-*` and `sqlite-fdb/query/zone-*` and nothing else. The players never
    reach Bao.
  - The certificate is issued by Bao itself: the org's intermediate CA (the chain in
    `~/.bao-creds/ca-chain.pem`, its key in 1Password) is installed into a `pki_int` mount from
    1Password with the root token, and the cert-auth role binds to the certificate's common name.
  :: related
  - RFD66606-2293, where this rule lived before the split.
  - RFD66606-2142, whose shape the `pki_int` mount follows.

  :: details How the certificate is issued
  The intermediate CA is installed in RFD66606-2142's shape
  (`bao secrets enable -path=pki_int pki`, `bao write pki_int/config/ca pem_bundle=@-`
  from `op item get`, a role `zone-fly` limited to that common name and a 30-day TTL). The
  cert and key land as Fly secrets on `weftspun-zone`.

  :: details The desk's own gh
  The desk's own `gh` is an hourly installation token minted the same way
  (`gh-installation-token <org>` through `bao-mint-github` over
  Tailscale), so every GitHub step needs a Bao tailnet node online,
  which `tailscale status` says.

  :: details The catalog and the plugin
  &{repo("service-openbao")} ships the catalog
  (`schema "zone-*"`, `exec append_mutation`, `exec append_snapshot`,
  `query latest_snapshot`) and sets `BAO_SQLITE_FDB_CATALOG` and
  `BAO_SQLITE_FDB_CLUSTER`. The operator registers and enables the
  plugin once with the root token from 1Password and creates the role,
  both recorded in the logbook with the sha256 Bao was given.
