Mobile and Forward+ renderers, so a CAD assembly with parts
turned transparent reads correctly from every angle"

  prose ~S"""
  :: decision
  The engine patch exists so that computer-aided design can turn
  parts transparent. A ghosted housing over a gear train, a curve
  net drawn inside the solid it defines: the parts nest and
  interpenetrate, and no order of meshes is correct for all of
  them at once. The patch composites through a froxel
  transmittance grid (Drobot, SIGGRAPH 2025) and the order stops
  mattering. Hair is not the reason; the hair cap in the project
  repository is a stress fixture, and DETAILS.md says why.
  :: problem
  A per-mesh sort cannot keep an inner part and its housing in the
  right relation: they overlap in depth, so whichever draws second
  is wrong somewhere on screen. Smoke, cloth sleeves and any two
  intersecting surfaces fail the same way.
  :: related
  - RFD 1033 (geometric algorithms), the curve-net and solid
    operators whose result this view shows.
  - RFD 2247 (property testing), the doctest-and-witness shape
    of the patch's tests.
  - RFD 2216 (Three.js blocklist), why this is in the engine and
    not in a viewer.

  :: details What is shipped
  An engine patch on `entities-godot`, not a module: the splat pass
  lives inside the scene shader as a pass mode, and the froxel
  buffers, the integrate dispatch and the fullscreen resolve are
  one effect shared by the Mobile and Forward+ renderers. A project
  setting turns it on. Surfaces with a blend mode other than Mix,
  and every surface under the Compatibility renderer, keep sorted
  blending.

  The math is pinned in Lean 4 first, in
  `4-entities/order-independent-transparency/lean/Oit/`, and the
  engine's `oit_math.h` is held to it by doctest cases and a
  witness-cpp ladder, with an FNV-1a hash over 4096 quantised rows
  that both sides carry as one literal. A hand edit to either side
  fails one command.
  :: details What is measured
  `checks/run.sh` in the project repository captures each scene
  with OIT on and off, sorted and scrambled, on both renderers, in
  mono and stereo, at one sample and at 4x MSAA, and counts the
  pixels that differ by more than 3 of 255.

  | run | parity band | order band | control |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | Mobile, box stack | 710 of 400,000 | 0 | planted scramble caught |
  | Mobile, box stack, 4x MSAA | 1,701 of 400,000 | 0 | occluded window caught |
  | Mobile, hair cap | 33,042 of 400,000 | 0 | planted scramble caught |
  | Forward+, box stack | 745 of 400,000 | 0 | planted scramble caught |
  | Forward+, box stack, 4x MSAA | 844 of 400,000 | 0 | occluded window caught |
  | Forward+, hair cap | 32,858 of 400,000 | 0 | planted scramble caught |

  The parity band is the froxel column's 6-pixel bleed across a
  silhouette, bounded and counted rather than hidden. Mobile
  accumulates at one sample under MSAA, so its edge band doubles;
  Forward+ accumulates at the full sample count and its band does
  not. The order band is the number that matters for CAD: with OIT
  on, scrambling the draw order changes no pixel.
  :: details Why hair is the fixture and not the reason
  Transparent hair cards are hard on the art side: too few layers
  expose the scalp, cards intersect, and the result convinces only
  when a practised artist made it. A person building an avatar for
  a social platform cannot carry the feature across either. The
  hair cap stays in `scenes/hair.tscn` because its 33,042
  silhouette pixels find defects the box stack does not; nothing
  ships it.
  :: details What it costs on the headset
  Transparency is expensive on a mobile tile renderer, and the
  froxel grid adds a splat pass, an integrate dispatch and a
  resolve over it. The Mobile port is the target because the
  drawing tools run there; the cost is measured on the device
  before a CAD scene ships with the setting on, and a scene that
  cannot afford it turns the parts opaque rather than sorting them.
