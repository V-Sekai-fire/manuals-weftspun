  :: hook
  The headset is the Steam Frame, with measured panels, compute and stream rates.
  :: intrigue
  PyroWave encodes both eyes at 200 Mbit/s against 317 Mbit/s of measured Wi-Fi. Does it fit?
  :: exit
  Open `logbook/logbook-steam-frame-sizing.md` for the apparatus and the numbers.
  :: decision
  - The headset is aarch64 SteamOS with SteamVR's OpenXR runtime, two 2160 by 2160 panels at 108,
    120 or 144 Hz, a recommended render target of 1728 by 1728 per eye, and 16 GB of memory shared
    with an Adreno 750.
  - One Slang kernel measures 1.28 FP32 and 2.57 FP16 TFLOPS on that GPU and 107 GFLOPS across its
    8 CPU cores, about 0.39 to 0.48 of the desk's M2 Pro on each.
