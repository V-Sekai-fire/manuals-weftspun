    feature "Pen meshing in a shared world with graded annotations: a person
draws their character and outfit with the meshing pen, wears it where others
see it, and gets a grade that teaches them to draw better"

    scope "interactor-dress-on, transport-meshing-pen, and the
V-Sekai client and server that host the loop"

    decision ~S"""
    The strategy is a board of vehicles: each is a whole product put in
    front of real people to test one assumption, never a car missing a
    wheel. One card moves at a time; later cards change with what the
    one in motion teaches. The loop is godot-sandbox guest ELFs a host
    loads, with no engine module of its own. The scoring it relies on
    runs the same shape: EditScore and MaskScore are decision models,
    godot-sandbox guests on ggml-rd and compute-rd, not a second
    runtime. OpenUSD is the internal format, VRM the one a player shares.
    """

    problem ~S"""
    An anonymous 16-person survey of the shared world's own community
    asked for two things: to create and share what others can see (8),
    and to be with people (8). One asked for emotes; none for rendered
    clips, hair motion or faces.
    """

    related ~S"""
    - RFD 2263 (the Skateboard's simulator gate), the card in motion.
    - RFD 2234 (dress-on pipeline), the loop the vehicles ride on.
    - RFD 1053 (OpenUSD as the internal format).
    - RFD 2229 (interchangeable parts), the rule new parts answer to.
    - RFD 2267 (persona NPCs in ported scenes), a parked content idea behind
      the vehicles, not one of them.

    details "The vehicles", ~S"""
    Each vehicle names what it tests, who tries it and where it stands.

    - **Bus ticket.** Do people want to make 3D things with a pen in VR,
      and what do they make? The public tried the published CASSIE sketch
      study. Done: people liked it, and wearables exist in what they drew
      (36 study shoes, a dress, two hats).
    - **Skateboard** (earliest testable). Can a person draw an outfit on
      an avatar and get back a garment that fits and drapes? The simulator
      first, a replayed sketch; then one person at a time on a standalone
      VR headset. In motion (RFD 2263).
    - **Scooter.** Will people save, share and wear what they made where
      others see it? The same creators and whoever they share with, phones
      included. Next: save as OpenUSD, export VRM, wear it in the world.
    - **Bicycle** (earliest usable). Will creators use it for their own
      avatar? Early adopters from the survey. Later: their own body (ANNY
      fitted in a guest, or their own mesh), rigged, delivered as VRM.
    - **Motorcycle** (earliest lovable). Will people show it to friends?
      Anyone. Later: the character in parts (body, head, hair), and more
      emotes and dances.
    - **Car.** Only if people ask for it. Later: faces and hair motion;
      nobody in the survey asked.

    Enabling work (CI, the drape's precision, comfort settings against
    motion sickness, the org's rules) is not a vehicle; it runs as the
    card in motion needs it.
    """

    details "Where it runs", ~S"""
    The first host is `transport-meshing-pen`: the xr-grid pen with the
    dress-on ELFs inserted through godot-sandbox. It has two
    implementations, chosen per process through the OpenXR runtime
    manifest (`XR_RUNTIME_JSON`):

    - the simulator, OXRSys with a replayed hand, repeatable on a desk
      and in CI;
    - a standalone VR headset on a Linux-based OS, a person holding the
      pen.

    Later hosts are the shared world's client and a dedicated server
    running the same ELFs, for people on phones and anyone who would
    rather not wait; the server hands back the VRM.
    """

    details "Formats", ~S"""
    - OpenUSD is internal: Pixal3D's answer, the loop's meshes and
      materials, and a person's strokes (one linear `BasisCurves` prim
      per stroke, the boundary mark a per-curve primvar).
    - VRM is delivery: what a player loads and shares.
    """

    details "The grade that teaches", ~S"""
    The loop ends in a critique, not only a wearable. The score step returns a
    grade with annotations on the drawing, so a person reads where it marked
    them down and learns to draw better; the wearable and the lesson come from
    one pass.

    The grader is a decision model, EditScore retrained, and it runs inside the
    loop, so it is sized to the loop. A checkpoint that needs a workstation to
    answer is too large; the target is a compact retrain that answers in the
    sandbox, not the biggest model available.
    """

    details "Moving in it: the mocap track, parked", ~S"""
    Wearing it and moving together needs body motion to drive the avatar.
    That track is Sinew, inertial motion capture from a worn suit. It sits
    behind the vehicles above, recorded here so it is not lost and not
    scheduled.

    - Shelved 2026-09-26: the mount-drift calibrator's training corpus
      shipped as `chibifire/mount-drift-caldata-motion` (558 rows of
      continuous microduck-gated clips, human and starforged phenotypes).
      Training the calibrator on it and measuring arm and hand mount
      recovery against a real-caldata baseline remains. Unpark when GPU
      budget and a held-out real capture are both in hand.
    - Shelved 2026-09-26: the IMU-recovery half, raw sensor to per-tracker
      orientation, stays unproven. Unpark with a clean low-IK recapture,
      the worn suit with motion smoothing and IK off, so the vendor pose
      approximates the raw tracker orientations for a direct match.
    - Shelved 2026-09-26: motion generation runs on the owned GPUs now
      (CUDA in WSL, both cards, via the bf16 op_repeat fix in the shared
      ggml). Unpark to scale the corpus with continuous motion-matching
      sequences when training needs more than the pilot.
    - Shelved 2026-09-26: fleet agents mint GitHub tokens from the bao
      GitHub secrets engine and land PRs through the merge queue. Unpark to
      make that the standing path when multi-agent coordination is the card
      in motion.
