  :: hook
  The rung's setup uses a fixed set of credentials, each with one named use.
  :: intrigue
  The Bao root token is read from 1Password exactly once and never stored, and a 403 is logged
  and handed back rather than worked around.
  :: exit
  Check a new setup step against this list, and run the first `gh repo create` as the check of
  the App.
  :: decision
  - The App installation `v-sekai-fire-persona[bot]` creates the new repositories and sets their
    rulesets.
  - The Bao root token is read from 1Password with `op` exactly once, for `bao plugin register`,
    `bao secrets enable` and the `zone-fly` cert role, never stored.
  - Fly changes run in the personal org without asking: the app, the dedicated IPv4, and whatever
    `weftspun-fdb`'s checks say.
  - The Frame is `steamos@fire-s-frame.local`, given a `Host frame` block in `~/.ssh/config`
    first thing.

  The operator says the App installation can create the repositories and set their rulesets. The
  first `gh repo create` is the check, and a 403 is logged and handed back rather than worked
  around. The logbook records the three Bao commands and the plugin sha256.
