  :: hook
  The two players stand in a station plaza that is a port, vendored by one script.
  :: intrigue
  The source scene generates every texture in code and keeps no mesh on disk.
  :: exit
  Run `tools/vendor_station.sh <commit>` with a commit some remote branch contains.
  :: decision
  The two players stand in a train-station plaza, a port of the MIT-licensed procedural three.js
  scene `sakuragaoka-station`, placed at &{repo("sakuragaoka-station")}
  (&{pin("sakuragaoka-station")}). The port lives in
  &{repo("entities-sakuragaoka-station")}, and the pen vendors it with
  `tools/vendor_station.sh <commit>`, which takes only a commit some remote branch contains.

  :: details Why the port rebuilds the scene
  Its 43,727 lines of JavaScript under `src/` generate every texture in code and keep no mesh on
  disk, so the port rebuilds the scene in the engine with MToon materials rather than importing
  it.
