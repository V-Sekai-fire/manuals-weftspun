  :: hook
  The servers' Linux double build has one source, the workflow's `linux-x86_64` job.
  :: intrigue
  The Frame's own Linux path lacks XCursor and xkbcommon, so which Linux build is the servers'?
  :: exit
  Check that a Linux build for the servers comes from the matrix's `linux-x86_64` job in the
  workflow.
  :: decision
  - Linux x86_64 double, the servers' build, comes only from the workflow: the matrix's
    `linux-x86_64` job is the servers' one Linux build, it runs `--headless` in the Fly image, and
    the pen's headless gates run on the `ubuntu` runner.

  - RFD66606-2293, where this rule lived before the split.

  :: details The Frame's own Linux path
  The Frame's own Linux path, the compatibility layer's missing XCursor and xkbcommon, is a
  runtime
  `dlopen`. The x86_64 `SteamLinuxRuntime_sniper` entry point under FEX is tried once from the
  headset and `LD_DEBUG=libs` logged either way, and no rung waits on it.
