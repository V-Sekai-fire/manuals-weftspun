  prose ~S"""
  :: hook
  The rc rung puts two people in one zone, talking, with the garment made elsewhere.
  :: intrigue
  Can one person in the headset and one on the desktop each see the other's avatar and hear them?
  The drawn garment must materialise from the worker zone and be worn.
  :: exit
  Run the two-client gate against the address of `weftspun-zone`, with the headset as one client
  and the desktop as the other and the sidecar.
  :: decision
  - rc: two people in one zone, talking, the garment made elsewhere, the zones live on Fly.
  - Playable: one in the headset, one on the desktop, each sees the other's avatar and hears
    them. The drawn garment materialises from the worker zone and is worn.
