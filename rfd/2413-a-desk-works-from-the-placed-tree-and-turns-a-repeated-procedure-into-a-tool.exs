  :: hook
  A desk works from the placed tree and turns a repeated procedure into a tool.
  :: intrigue
  A procedure a desk repeats as one-off shell is lost, where an Elixir DSL or a tool in the tree
  stays.
  :: exit
  Check a repeated procedure against the rule: write it as an Elixir DSL or a tool in the tree,
  not one-off shell.
  :: decision
  - An agent works from the placed tree, and branches where a pin is old.
  :: related
  - RFD66606-2294, where this rule lived before the split.
