  :: hook
  Guest geometry far from the origin is held in df32, a pair of float32 values.
  :: intrigue
  Can a stroke be placed 3.8e8 m out when float32 spacing there is about 32 m?
  :: exit
  Check that any guest geometry far from the origin is held in df32, and that the canvas origin
  crosses the API boundary in df32 or double.
  :: decision
  - df32, a double-float pair of a high and a low float32, is the
    scalar for guest geometry that must hold far from the origin,
    with `two_sum`, `quick_two_sum` and `two_prod` as the anny Slang
    kernels write them.

  - RFD66606-2293, where this rule lived before the split.

  :: details Canvas-local coordinates
  Graph math runs in
  canvas-local coordinates. The canvas origin crosses the API
  boundary in df32 or double. float32 stays a one-line switch, kept
  for comparison against float32 sources.
  :: details The problem
  On the Moon, about 3.8e8 m out, float32
  spacing is about 32 m, some 480 soda cans, so float32 world
  coordinates cannot place a stroke there.
