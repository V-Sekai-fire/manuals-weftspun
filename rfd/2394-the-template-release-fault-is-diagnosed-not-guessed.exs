  :: hook
  The template_release fault is diagnosed with a backtrace, not guessed at.
  :: intrigue
  A guessed fault has no backtrace behind it, and the rung ships on the editor build.
  :: exit
  Run `tools/probe_load.gd` flat and headless on the debug-symbol template, under the two
  controls, and put the backtrace into `logbook-steam-frame-sizing.md`.
  :: decision
  - The `template_release` fault is diagnosed, not guessed: the debug-symbol template, flat and
    headless with `tools/probe_load.gd`.
  - The rung ships on the editor build.
  :: related
  - RFD66606-2293, where this rule lived before the split.
