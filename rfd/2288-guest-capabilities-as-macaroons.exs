    feature "A guest ELF reaches outside its own memory only through a
capability: a macaroon that a ReBAC check mints, checked once at the host
call and cached for the VM"

    scope "the godot-sandbox addon's host-call table, every guest ELF that
makes host calls, and the ReBAC tuples of RFD 2200"

    decision ~S"""
    Capabilities are an allowlist. A guest starts with none. Each host
    call that reaches outside the guest's own memory needs one, and a new
    need gets a new, narrow capability, never a wider old one. A
    capability is a macaroon. A ReBAC check (RFD 2200) mints it, with
    caveats that name the VM, the verb, the object, an expiry at most 5 s
    away and the VM's revocation epoch. The host verifies the macaroon's
    HMAC chain once and caches the grant in that VM's host-call table, so
    each later call costs a bit test and two integer compares. The host
    verifies the macaroon again every 5 s. Bumping a VM's epoch voids its
    cached grants at their next call. A guest's writes to its own memory
    are not host calls, and nothing checks them.
    """

    problem ~S"""
    RFD 2287's CA keeps its root key in guest memory, but a VM transfer
    carries all of that memory, and so does a host read of it. A ReBAC
    check on every host call is too slow for calls made every frame, and
    no check makes every guest a leak. So the check runs once per grant,
    needs no network round trip, and costs little to repeat.

    details "The macaroon", ~S"""
    The host that runs the guest holds the macaroon root key and mints.
    Before it mints, it asks the ReBAC store whether a tuple relates the
    subject to the object with the verb. No tuple, no macaroon. The
    caveats are `vm`, `verb`, `object`, `expires` and `epoch`. A zone that
    hands work to another zone adds caveats before it passes the
    macaroon on, which narrows it without a round trip. Nobody can remove
    a caveat, because the HMAC chain then fails.
    """

    details "The hot path", ~S"""
    The host-call table holds, per VM, one bit per granted capability,
    its expiry and the epoch it was granted at. A host call checks the
    bit, compares the clock with the expiry, and compares the stored
    epoch with the VM's current one. Past the expiry the host verifies the
    macaroon again and refreshes the entry. The 5 s bound keeps a revoked
    grant short-lived and a retry cheap.
    """

    details "Adding a capability", ~S"""
    A capability names one verb on one object, and the table below carries
    the three that exist as `capability` declarations (RFD 2291, ReBAC as a
    DSL feature), so a reader counts them rather than reading for them. A
    new need adds a declaration for that narrow verb and object, and a
    tuple that mints it. A wider capability is not allowed; a second,
    narrow one is. `ca.elf` gets no `transfer` or memory-read capability.

    Each has a control, and each runs with the guest's real host calls.

    - A host call with no capability is refused. Control: the same call
      with its capability goes ahead.
    - A call after an epoch bump is refused; the same call before the
      bump goes ahead.
    - A call past the expiry is refused until the macaroon verifies
      again.
    - A macaroon with one caveat changed fails its HMAC check, and so
      does one with a caveat removed.
    - A narrowed macaroon passed to another zone cannot do what the wider
      one could.
    - The cost per call is measured against the same call with no check.
      The guest's own memory writes show no change.
