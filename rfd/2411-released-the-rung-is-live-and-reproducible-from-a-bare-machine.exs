  :: hook
  A bare directory bootstrapped to the released tag reaches the rc build and plays it.
  :: intrigue
  Without the bootstrap line, a Frame cannot reach the rc build to play it against the live zones.
  :: exit
  Run the bootstrap line in a bare directory, then play the rc build on a Frame against the live
  zones.
  :: decision
  released: the rung, live and reproducible from a bare machine. Playable: anyone with the
  bootstrap line and a Frame reaches the rc build and plays it against the live zones.
