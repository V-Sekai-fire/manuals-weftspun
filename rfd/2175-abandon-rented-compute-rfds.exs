  :: hook
  Five RFDs that name rented compute are abandoned and stay in the register.
  :: intrigue
  CLAUDE.md's hard constraint is "the local desktop GPU is the only compute; RunPod and Vast.ai
  blocklisted". Five open RFDs still name rented compute as their decision.
  :: exit
  Read RFD66606-2169 next, the companion walk-back of the same class.
  :: decision
  Abandon five RFDs (1132, 1140, 1163, 2133, 2138) whose decisions name RunPod or Vast.ai rented
  compute, which CLAUDE.md's hard constraint now blocklists. Each moves to `abandoned` alongside
  this document landing.
  :: problem
  The RFD's whole reason for existing contradicts the blocklist. The RFDs themselves stay in
  the register for citation, per CLAUDE.md's "retractions stay in place next to what they
  retract".
  :: related
  Retracts: urn:oid:1.3.6.1.4.1.66606.1.1.{1132,1140,1163},

  Anchor: CLAUDE.md's Compute hard constraint and the RunPod, Vast.ai blocklist rows.
  Companion: RFD66606-2169 (studio-core abandonment), same class of walk-back.
