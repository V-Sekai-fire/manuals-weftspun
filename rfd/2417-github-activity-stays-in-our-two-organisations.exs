  :: hook
  All GitHub activity stays in V-Sekai-fire and chibifire-stages, and upstreams hear nothing from
  us.
  :: intrigue
  An `owner/repo#N` reference or an issue or pull request URL in pushed text is posted back onto
  the upstream's timeline.
  :: exit
  Check a push against the rule: cite an upstream change by its bare commit SHA.
  :: decision
  - All GitHub activity stays in V-Sekai-fire and chibifire-stages: forks, new repositories and
    pushes, and no pull request, issue, comment or mention in any other organisation.
  - Pushed text cites an upstream change by its bare commit SHA, never by an `owner/repo#N`
    reference or an issue or pull request URL.

  Reading and cloning public repositories is fine.

  GitHub posts those back onto the upstream's timeline.
