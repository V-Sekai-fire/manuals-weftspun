  :: hook
  The Frame's Proton tweak is rebuilt by a script and checked by sha256, not made by hand.
  :: intrigue
  The Frame's `~/rfd2287/proton-xrfix` is stock Proton 11.0 (ARM64) with a wineopenxr tweak made
  by
  hand, so a change made only by hand cannot be pinned.
  :: exit
  Run `tools/frame/proton-xrfix.sh` on a fresh copy and check that the sha256s match.
  :: decision
  - The tweak is reproduced, not pinned.
  - `tools/frame/proton-xrfix.sh` applies the same change to a fresh copy and checks the sha256s
    match, and the logbook records the diff.
  - The harness runs on the scripted copy from then on.
  :: related
  - RFD66606-2293, where this rule lived before the split.
