  :: decision
  See `DETAILS.md` for the full argument.
  :: problem
  The cores carry compute kernels (hit raycasts, the budgeter solve,
  geometry costing) that need to be verified once and run as GPU
  compute, with the dispatch wrapped behind the flat C ABI port
  (`rfd/2044-lean4-kernel-cores-flat-c-host-adapters`). Hand-porting a
  kernel from a separate spec to a shader drifts.

    context ~S"""
    The cores carry compute kernels, hit raycasts, the budgeter solve,
    geometry costing, that need to be verified once and run as GPU
    compute, with the dispatch wrapped behind the flat C ABI port
    (`rfd/2044-lean4-kernel-cores-flat-c-host-adapters`). Hand-porting a
    kernel from a separate spec to a shader drifts.
    """

    drivers ~S"""
    - One verified Lean source per kernel, with no separate shader to
      drift.
    - The kernel runs on the GPU and integrates with GPU convergence; the
      CPU Slang target lacks that integration.
    - Integer ops keep the kernel deterministic across conformant devices.
    """

    options ~S"""
    - Hand-write each kernel as a shader from a separate spec.
    - Lower a CPU host target through Slang.
    - Author the kernel in Lean and lower it to SPIR-V.
    """

    outcome ~S"""
    Chosen option: author the compute kernels in Lean and lower them to
    Slang through [lean-slang](https://github.com/V-Sekai-fire/lean-slang),
    then run `slangc -target spirv` to SPIR-V (`.spv`), and dispatch the
    `.spv` behind the flat C ABI, because SPIR-V runs the kernel on the
    GPU with the convergence integration the CPU Slang target lacks, and
    one verified Lean source produces the shipped kernel. The `idtx-flow`
    repository already depends on `LeanSlang` and byte-pins the emitted
    Slang against committed source with `native_decide`.
    """

    consequences ~S"""
    - One Lean kernel source produces the `.spv`, so the spec and the
      shipped kernel stay one artifact.
    - The lowered Slang and the `.spv` are committed and byte-pinned, so a
      regen that drifts fails the pin.
    - The kernels use integer ops, so the SPIR-V stays deterministic
      across conformant devices
      (`rfd/2034-deterministic-cores-integer-seeded-rng`).
    """

    confirmation ~S"""
    The emitted Slang matches its committed byte-pin, and the dispatched
    `.spv` kernel passes the core fixtures.
