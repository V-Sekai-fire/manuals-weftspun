hook a desk can run the same way"

ruleset 23145233 in this repository"

  prose ~S"""
  :: decision
  The workflow has one job, `prek`. Gates that need only the tree
  are ordinary hooks. Gates that need a base ref or a code-host
  token are `ci-*` hooks in the manual stage, which the job calls by
  id with `GATE_BASE` and `GH_TOKEN` set; a local commit never runs
  them. An unset `GATE_BASE` fails the hook. The merge queue
  requires one check, `prek`.
  :: problem
  Nine jobs repeated checks prek could run, each rendering the RFDs
  again, and the ruleset required nine names that had to match the
  workflow by hand. The list the working agreements stated had
  already drifted from the ruleset.
  :: related
  - RFD 2245, the red merge that made gates required.
  - RFD 2232, the render every gate reads.

  :: details What is measured
  Locally through prek 0.5.3, `ci-comment-ladder`,
  `ci-trope-density`, `ci-spdx` and `ci-rfd-canary` pass on
  `main/main`, and `ci-comment-ladder` fails with `GATE_BASE` unset.
  On the pull request that landed it, `prek` passed; the ruleset was
  then set to require `prek` alone and the merge state went clean.
  :: details Warnings kept honest
  jose 1.11.12, pulled in by ex_mcp, uses bare `catch`, which OTP 29
  deprecates. The job silences that one warning only when jose, OTP
  and Elixir read 1.11.12, 29 and 1.20.4, and any other tuple leaves
  the warnings on with a notice naming what it found.
