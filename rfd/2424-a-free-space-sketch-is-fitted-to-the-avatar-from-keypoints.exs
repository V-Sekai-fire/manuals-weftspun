  prose ~S"""
  :: hook
  A sketch drawn in free space is placed on the avatar from keypoints and pushed out of the body.
  :: intrigue
  Can a whole dress session sit outside the body? On CASSIE's dress session, 0 of 12307 points
  end inside the body by winding number, and 4 junctions miss.
  :: exit
  Count the points that end inside the body by winding number, as on CASSIE's dress session where
  0 of 12307 do.
  :: decision
  - A sketch drawn in free space is placed on the avatar from anthropometric keypoints in
    `starforged-std-3001-appendix-e`: stature, crotch height as stature less sitting height, and
    hip breadth. Appendix E carries no waist height, so it comes from the ISO 7250 typical value.
  - Then each stroke, in drawing order, is pushed out of the body by `mujoco.elf`: rays against
    the mesh triangles, a point inside when its exit normal says so, and 4 mm of clearance, about
    five credit cards stacked.
  - A junction stays pinned to the earlier stroke's pushed position.
