  :: hook
  Three.js is blocklisted as an in-browser 3D runtime; Godot ships every 3D surface.
  :: intrigue
  A three.js path forks the scene-graph, material pipeline, animation graph, and lighting
  model that the workspace otherwise ships through Godot.
  :: exit
  Read RFD66606-2215 next for the one-runtime argument behind this blocklist.
  :: decision
  Blocklist three.js as an in-browser 3D runtime. Substitute is
  **Godot as a native binary per platform** built from
  `entities-godot-sandbox` with the Vulkan renderer (MoltenVK on
  macOS).

    over three.js for a different workload.

  :: details The objection
  Three.js itself is MIT-licensed, the objection is not
  licence, it is
  runtime story: the workspace ships every 3D surface via Godot,
  and a three.js path forks the scene-graph, material pipeline,
  animation graph, and lighting model.
  :: details Live rows
  `CLAUDE.md` blocklist table + `BLOCKLIST.md` full
  section (the section body carries the argument in current form).
