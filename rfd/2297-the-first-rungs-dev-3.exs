  :: decision
  dev.3 ships the game as one Windows x86_64 executable with its `.pck`
  embedded, exported at double precision, and plays it on the Frame.
  :: problem
  dev.1 and dev.2 shipped the double editor, the addon and the guest
  ELFs, so a player needs a pen checkout to open them.

  - RFD 2293, the workspace, the ladder and dev.1; its release rules hold here.

  Operator, 2026-10-02.

  - Windows x86_64: `meshing-pen-windows.exe` with its `.pck` embedded
    and the addon's `libgodot_riscv.windows.template_release.double.x86_64.dll`
    beside it, released as two plain assets with no archive around them.
    There is no macOS export; Linux players run the Windows build through
    the compatibility layer, so there is no Linux export.
  - The export runs headless on the pinned Linux double editor from
    `ENGINE_TAG`'s templates, unsigned, by `tools/export_dev3.exs` in
    `release.yml`'s `export` job on an ubuntu runner, inside the job's
    five minutes; each engine call runs under `timeout`.
  - The release job FAILs when any asset is a `.zip` or a `.dmg`; its
    control plants `x.zip` and must fail.
  - Gate: `tools/smoke_export.exs` launches the exported executable on the
    Windows desk until it quits and finds `dress_on`, `curvenet`, `usd` and
    `mujoco` loaded from the pack. Its control, the bare double
    `template_release` executable beside the same `.dll`, carries no pack
    and must fail. No run forces headless, and CI's Windows runner has only
    a software rasterizer, so CI counts the smoke as unchecked and the
    logbook carries the desk's result.
  - Orbit views (also called contact sheets, turnaround sheets or
    turntable renders) of the joy features, rendered by the exported game
    running `tools/orbit_views.sgd` on the Windows desk and on the Frame,
    each with its `.cff` and `.tsv` under the contract-orbit-views
    standard and checked with the `zero_views` control.
  - Playtest: the release uploaded to the Frame as a development title by
    `tools/frame/push.sh` and played by a named person through
    `run-xr.sh`, with `still.sh` and `clip.sh` under `logs/`; the persona
    plays the same executable through oxrsys on the Windows desk. The
    Frame run happens when the operator asks for it, and the Mac desk is
    told before the headset is touched.

  dev.2 shipped the double editor, the addon and the guest ELFs for a
  checkout to open instead.
