  This Mac runs the desktop client: the macOS double editor, the addon library and compute-rd.
  :: intrigue
  Without a macOS client, the pen's parked `macos.yml` stays parked and the headless gates have
  no macOS arm.
  :: exit
  Run `tools/run-mac.sh` beside `run-windows.sh` to start the flat client and the sidecar on this
  Mac.
  :: decision
  - This Mac as the desktop client: the macOS double editor from the release, the addon's macOS
    double library, compute-rd on Metal through the same `rdc::Device`.
