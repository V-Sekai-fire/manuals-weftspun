  :: hook
  The standalone headset draws at most 700k triangles in view per frame, split between world and
  characters.
  :: intrigue
  Past 700k triangles in view the frame is over the operator's budget, and the crowd of
  non-player characters is the first to drop to impostors.
  :: exit
  Check a scene against the budget: at most 700k triangles in view per frame, 250k for world
  geometry and 450k for characters.
  :: decision
  The operator's budget for the standalone headset: at most 700k triangles in
  view per frame, of which world geometry gets 250k (400k at most) and characters
  450k. A crowd of non-player characters holds 150k of the character share and
  drops to impostors first. One equal-error LOD threshold over the frame enforces
  it, and the LODs come from Godot's own `generate_lods` on welded meshes, except
  the blossom cards, whose levels are the cluster LOD DAGs of RFD66606-2367.
  :: related
  - RFD66606-2294, where this rule lived before the split.
  - RFD66606-2367, the cluster LOD DAGs of the blossom cards.
