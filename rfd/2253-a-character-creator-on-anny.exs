  :: decision
  The creator is RFD 2251's second front door: where 2251 hands the
  chain a generated body, a person sets 948 target weights on the
  baked ANNY asset. Six phenotype axes, 52 facial actions under
  FACS action-unit numbers, 254 signed local dials by body region.
  Joints follow the shape through ANNY's own joint tables.
  `rig` through `render` are 2251's blocks, unchanged. Export is
  pure data: morph targets, skin weights, one humanoid bone map.
  :: problem
  VRoid Studio is proprietary, MakeHuman is ageing, SMPL is
  non-commercial; a person wanting a permissive parametric human has
  no creator to open. Every part of one is here: the model, the
  joint tables, the anthropometry tables, a slider demo in the
  Python the runtime forbids. Nothing joins them into a thing used.
  :: related
  - [RFD 2251](../2251-image-to-godot-character-as-an-fbd/): the chain

  prose ~S"""
  :: details Three ways to start a body
  A body starts one of three ways: from the sliders; from an image,
  through RFD 2251's chain; or from a photo, whose detected keypoints
  fit ANNY's shape by RFD 1143's loop (the keypoints-to-ANNY loop)
  before the sliders take over. All three end in the same baked ANNY
  asset and the same export.
  :: details This RFD was drafted by an AI and read by a human before it shipped.
  Drafted 2026-09-15 from a survey of the RFD corpus and the tree,
  after the operator asked for work whose payoff lands with people
  outside the workspace and pointed at RFD 2251 as the thing to
  build on. The seam with 2251 is the operator's call; the slider
  math and the check list are the AI's proposal.
  :: details Who it is for
  A VTuber, an indie developer, an artist or a researcher who wants
  a rigged, expressive human they may ship commercially. Today that
  person picks between a proprietary creator, a Python creator whose
  community has thinned, and a body model whose licence forbids the
  shipping. ANNY is Apache-2.0 and descends from the MakeHuman
  targets, so the permissive parametric human already exists as a
  model. It does not exist as a thing a person opens, and a creator
  is the kind of tool that is opened for a decade once it is good.
  :: details What exists, by path
  Every ingredient is in the tree. The creator is the join.

  | ingredient | path | what it gives the creator |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | baked asset | `tools/bake_anny.py` in &{repo("entities-anny-creator")}, run once under the `bake` pixi environment | the `anny` topology at 13,718 vertices and 27,420 triangles, 104 joints, 8 of 9 influences kept (2 vertices lose a 0.001 weight), 948 morph targets in one 64 MB glb |
  | phenotype math | `src/anny/models/phenotype.py` in &{repo("interactor-anny")}, `utils/interpolation.py` | six free axes over 17 anchor slots; race, cup and firmness are constants folded into the bake |
  | joint tables | `src/anny/data/cached/anny.pth` in &{repo("interactor-anny")}, read by the bake | per-target joint head deltas and orientation-matrix deltas, linear in the same coefficients |
  | facial actions | `src/anny/data/faceunits01/targets/faceunits` in &{repo("interactor-anny")} | 52 targets, computed as deltas by `compute_blendshape_targets.py` |
  | local dials | `src/anny/data/mpfb2/targets` in &{repo("interactor-anny")} | 254 targets grouped by body region |
  | partition proofs | &{repo("contract-hm08-partition")} | `body`, `HelperGeometry`, `JointCubes` partition the mesh with no gap; Lean 4, no `sorry` |
  | keypoint anchors | &{repo("contract-anny-keypoint-anchors")} | 133 COCO-WholeBody anchors, for a later image front door |
  | anthropometry | &{repo("chibifire/starforged-std-3001-appendix-e")}, `human` config | percentile spans for presets |
  | slider reference | `src/anny/examples/interactive_demo.py` in &{repo("interactor-anny")} | 740 lines of Gradio with GLB export: the parameter math to port, never to run |
  | runtime | `4-entities/godot-rfd-2251-fire` | the binary with `skin_tokens`, `kimodo`, `pixal3d`, `llm`, `motion_bricks` |
  :: details The slider math
  Three kinds of control, one operator underneath (RFD 2244).

  A phenotype axis is a scalar in [0, 1]. ANNY resolves it to
  weights over that axis's anchors by piecewise-linear
  interpolation (`linear_interpolation_coefficients`; age anchors
  run from a third below zero to one), and the weight on a macro
  target is the product of the anchor weights its name carries:
  four factors for a `universal` target, five for `height` and
  `proportions`. The bake folds the constant race, cup and firmness
  slots in and merges rows that share a free pattern, leaving 388
  macro targets. `scripts/anny_coeffs.gd` is the port, checked
  against the Python model on 20 seeded parameter vectors before a
  slider is trusted.

  A facial action and a local dial are direct target weights. The
  creator groups the 254 dials by the body region ANNY's target
  index files them under, so the panel reads as head, torso, arms,
  legs, hands and feet rather than as a list of 254 names.

  ANNY's `anny` rig does not read the JointCubes; that is the
  `makehuman` rig's strategy. It carries, for every target, a delta
  on each joint head and a delta on a per-joint 3x3 matrix whose
  nearest rotation is the joint's rest orientation, both linear in
  the same coefficient vector the mesh uses. The bake writes those
  tables beside the glb and `scripts/anny_rig.gd` evaluates them
  (polar iteration for the nearest rotation), then writes bone
  rests and the matching skin bind poses. The creator never authors
  a joint position, so a slider moves the skeleton with the skin,
  which is the property a creator needs and a static rig lacks.
  :: details The seam with RFD 2251
  RFD 2251's `prepare_reference`, `generate_part` and `assemble`
  produce a body from an image. The creator produces a body from a
  person, and hands the chain the same thing those three blocks do:
  one scene with a mesh the later blocks can rig, express, animate
  and render. `rig` finds a skeleton already bound, so it retargets
  rather than solves. `expressions` finds the 52 targets on the
  head. `animate` and `render` do not know which front door was
  used, and that is the test that the seam is in the right place.

  Export follows the deployment rule: the glTF carries morph
  targets, skin weights and animation samplers, and the VRM 1.0
  extension carries the humanoid bone map from ANNY's joints. No
  driver, no constraint, no runtime script rides in the file. The
  route to the VRM bytes is RFD 2213's sandboxed writer when it
  lands and a direct extension write until then.
  :: details What is measured before it ships
  | check | pass condition | control |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | slider parity | for 20 seeded parameter vectors, the ported shape and the Python model agree at every vertex within the asset's own glb round-trip error | a deliberately mis-ordered anchor table must fail |
  | joints follow shape | every joint sits at its cube centroid after any slider move | a planted cube range one vertex short must fail |
  | pure-data export | the exported glTF parses with no extension outside `KHR_*` and `VRMC_*`, and no node carries a script | a file with one driver added must fail |
  | presets hit the table | the 5th, 50th and 95th percentile stature presets land within a stated tolerance of the Appendix E `human` rows | a preset built from the fictional config must fail |
  | topology pinned | the loaded asset has 13,718 vertices, 27,420 triangles and 104 bones, the `anny` topology; the SMPL-X interop topology is never baked | an asset at the SMPL-X vertex count must fail |

  A tolerance is stated in millimetres and in a household object
  when the check is written, not here, because the asset's
  round-trip error is measured at that point rather than assumed.
  :: details Names that stay out of the artifact
  ANNY's 52 facial-action labels are the convention name of a
  proprietary blendshape set, which the working agreements block
  from shipping artifacts. The creator's panel, its export and its
  documentation use FACS action-unit numbers. The source labels
  stay in the source, where they are NAVER's to keep.
  :: details What this RFD does not decide
  Clothing: dress-on (RFD 2234) is a corpus pipeline today and a
  creator garment panel later, on the same operator. Hair, which
  the fixture does not carry. A web build: three.js and WebGPU are
  blocklisted, so a browser form means the engine's own web export
  and is a separate decision. The image front door: RFD 2251 owns
  it, and the keypoint anchors are the bridge when it is wanted.
