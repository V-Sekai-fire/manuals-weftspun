  feature "A godot-sandbox guest carries bulk game traffic over QUIC,
HTTP/3 and WebTransport at binary-translated speed, and the first
channel it carries mints tokens from a key the host never sees"
  scope "a godot-sandbox guest ELF running the QUIC stack, the zone
server and clients that host it, and a token-minting channel;
`interactor-fabric-zone`'s ELFs (RFD 2287) are its first user"

  prose ~S"""
  :: decision
  QUIC, HTTP/3 and WebTransport run inside a RISC-V guest ELF that
  libriscv binary-translates to near native speed: picoquic with
  h3zero, TLS 1.3 through picotls on mbedTLS. The host relays UDP
  through `PacketPeerUDP` and ticks timers without seeing
  plaintext. The first channel is a signer on a zone server whose
  app key lives only in guest memory; it checks a ReBAC tuple and
  returns a one-hour installation token, never the key.
  :: problem
  A key on the desk, or a helper that hands out a token, is open to
  every script there. Only a separate peer keeps it out of reach.
  :: related
  - RFD 2255 (SSH tunnel to Bao), the path the signer peer's
    identity can use to reach Bao.
  - RFD 2060 (org-scoped app token), the token this mints.
  - RFD 2200 (ReBAC agent roles as tuples), the authorization.
  - RFD 2287 (the first rung), its first user.

  prose ~S"""
  :: details The exchange
  1. The signer guest starts, logs in to Bao with its own cert
     identity over mTLS terminated inside the guest, and reads the
     app key into guest memory.
  2. An agent's guest opens a WebTransport session to the zone
     server on UDP 7443 and sends a mint request naming itself.
  3. The signer checks `agent:<cn>#mint@app:<app>` in the
     relationship store and refuses without it.
  4. It signs a JWT, exchanges it for an installation token over
     TLS inside the guest, and returns the token and its expiry.
  :: details What is not settled
  - **Throughput.** Bulk game traffic needs the binary-translated
    guest to keep up with a native QUIC stack. Nothing is measured
    yet; the comparison is the same stack built native against the
    translated guest, same payload, same link.
  - **Per-call instruction budget.** Translation shortens a TLS 1.3
    handshake but does not remove the sandbox's per-call limit, so
    the budget for this guest is set from a measured handshake.
  - **Transport.** WebTransport is the proposal; ENet through the
    existing ENet sandbox is the fallback if the translated QUIC
    guest cannot carry the traffic.
  - **Licences.** picoquic, picotls and mbedTLS are MIT or
    Apache-2.0. libriscv and godot-sandbox are BSD-3-Clause, so
    an MIT-or-Apache-only rule needs an exception for the host.
  - **Which peer.** A zone server the operator runs, on owned
    hardware or the existing hosting; the choice decides who can
    read that peer's memory.
