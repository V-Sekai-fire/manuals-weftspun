  :: details dev.2: dev.1's counted gaps closed and the addon rebased
  Operator, 2026-10-02.

  - The gaps `logbook-rfd2287-rung.md` counts: a teleport onto the 8 cm
    handrail is refused through a walkable-floor ray; `solid_land` gets
    a control of its own, apart from `no_resolve`; `tools/probe_player.gd`
    gets a negative control and runs in CI; a frame-time baseline is
    taken with no station loaded, so the frame time has its floor beside
    it.
  - The godot-sandbox fork rebased on upstream `8a1774d`
    (V-Sekai-fire/godot-sandbox#15), with the host's unboxed-argument
    path packing `Vector2`, `Vector3`, `Vector4` and `Plane` at double
    rather than as float, its CI green, the addon released from it, and
    every guest rebuilt for the packed-array calls at `ECALL` +68 and +69.

  Each gap closes with the control the logbook counts it as lacking.
  The order is the rebase, then the addon release, then the guest
  rebuilds, then the tag, because a guest built against the old numbers
  lands its packed acquire on the array-window call. Playable: dev.1's
  route.
  :: details Which features are likely to bring joy
  Each forecast uses RFD66606-2412's sense-of-wonder rubric and RFD66606-2295's
  tag form.

  | rung | feature | criteria | joy |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | dev.2 | the godot-sandbox rebase | none | (remote, p=0.05) |

  dev.2's own feature is plumbing, so its joy rests on what it unblocks.
  :: details The problem
  RFD66606-2293 is the Skateboard's workspace and its whole ladder, and the
  dev rungs past dev.1 change daily while the rest of it does not. Kept
  there, each rung's edit is a diff to the workspace plan.
