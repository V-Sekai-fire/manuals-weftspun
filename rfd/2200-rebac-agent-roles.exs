  prose ~S"""
  :: decision
  Model agent roles as **ReBAC relationship tuples** in a Bao KV mount
  at `relationships/`, one tuple per row, key shape
  `<subject>--<verb>--<object>`. This RFD owns the verb vocabulary and
  declares it in a `rebac` block (RFD 2291, ReBAC as a DSL feature), so
  the verbs are data rather than a table a gate parses. Three named roles
  fall out: coordinator (MPS), gpu-experimenter (CUDA),
  edge-qat-specialist (HAILO). `DETAILS.md` carries verbs, rows, scopes.
  :: problem
  The current `agents-rw` policy is one shared grant across every
  peer. Adding a fourth agent that shouldn't touch GPU code, or a
  Hailo-specific agent that must not touch the 3090, means either a
  new per-agent policy (RBAC sprawl) or ad-hoc restrictions in prose.
  Neither answers the question the shared-$HOME clobber raised: the
  risk is the **relationship** between two agents, not the identity of
  either.
  :: section Non-goals
  Not enforced today. The tuples are data; nothing gates a KV write
  against them yet. When enforcement lands it goes in a separate RFD.
  Also not covered: an external ReBAC engine (OpenFGA, SpiceDB).
  The tuples-in-KV shim is the minimum that answers the question we
  have. A production ReBAC engine is a future call.

  details_title "ReBAC agent roles as tuples, not per-agent policy sprawl"

  prose ~S"""
  :: details The tuple shape
  Each tuple is one KV row under `relationships/`. Key format is
  `<subject>--<verb>--<object>` (double-hyphen separator, all segments
  lowercase-kebab). Data is the parsed fields plus a timestamp:

      subject: mps-45994b
      verb: authors
      object: weftspun-agreements
      created_at: <unix>

  The verb vocabulary is below, one `verb` declaration per row. It is
  small on purpose. A new verb is a `verb` line in this RFD before it is
  a row anywhere; overloading an existing verb is fine when the mapping
  is obvious.

  A row whose verb carries a `!` is a denial: `<subject>--!<verb>--<object>`
  says the subject does not hold the relation, and it carries its reason
  after `#`. Default deny already covers what no row names; a denial row
  answers a question an agent would otherwise have to ask.
  :: details Tuples in a document
  `CLAUDE.md` carries the desk agent's tuples in a fenced `rebac` block,
  one row per line, with a note or a reason after `#`. The block is
  rendered from the `renders_into "CLAUDE.md"` rows declared here, so the
  document holds no second copy to drift from.

  `mix rfd.rebac` holds every block in the corpus against the vocabulary,
  and `scripts/check_rebac.exs` holds `CLAUDE.md` against it on its own.
  Both read `RFD.ReBAC`, so a verb no RFD declares fails, and so does a
  denial without its reason, a repeated row, or a relation both granted
  and denied.
  :: details The three roles
  **Coordinator**, MPS. Bao admin (`mps-admin` policy). Authors
  `weftspun-agreements` (CLAUDE.md, RFDs, doctrine, retraction pointers).
  Provisions agent identities on operator instruction. Drafts logbook
  entries **only** when relaying a peer's measurement, with the peer
  credited as the measuring session. Does not own ML hypotheses; does not
  run GPU experiments; does not touch peer hardware.

  **GPU-experimenter**, CUDA. Owns 3090 + 4090. Authors
  `gpu-experiments`, Lumina2 distillation, LLaDA-o step sweeps, OmniGen2
  comparisons, EditScore ladder runs. Publishes measurements as logbook
  PRs on its own branches; drafts + files its own retractions when a
  result doesn't survive scale-up. `agents-rw` policy; no admin ops
  (no mint, no revoke, no policy edit).

  **Edge-QAT-specialist**, HAILO. Owns USB-Hailo NPU. Authors
  `edge-qat-experiments`, RFD 2199 direction, HailoRT + DFC compiler
  work, HEF deployment. Same PR-driven measurement discipline as
  gpu-experimenter. `agents-rw` policy; does not touch CUDA's cards, and
  CUDA does not touch the Hailo NPU, even though both agents `runs-on`
  the same `windows-desktop`.
  :: details What the tuples buy that RBAC doesn't
  **Composability.** "CUDA touches the 3090" is not a permission written
  into a policy; it is `cuda-a63415 owns desktop-3090` and a general rule
  "an agent's `owns` relations bound the hardware it can drive." Adding
  a fourth agent that inherits GPU access means adding `<new>--owns--
  <card>`, not editing a policy.

  **Cross-cutting constraints from graph traversal.** The shared-$HOME
  risk that killed CUDA's key earlier today is graph-reachable:

      ?x runs-on ?h  AND  ?y runs-on ?h  AND  ?x != ?y

  resolves to `(cuda-a63415, hailo-552dfa, windows-desktop)`. A future
  onboarding flow can check "does this new agent share a host with an
  existing agent?" mechanically from the tuples, and if so require the
  per-agent-suffixed cred dir before enrolment. RBAC has no way to
  express that.

  **Retraction responsibility.** When an RFD is retracted, the doctrine
  in CLAUDE.md says the pointer names the logbook entry that carries the
  measurement. `authored-by` tuples on the RFD and the logbook entry
  resolve to the same agent, so the pointer's target is not a lookup;
  it is the second tuple that shares a subject with the first.
  :: details What the tuples do not do today
  No policy consults them. `agents-rw` still writes based on identity
  templating, not tuple membership. This RFD lands the **schema and the
  tuples**, not enforcement.

  Enforcement would need one of:

  1. **Client-side check in the agent-sync skill.** Read
     `relationships/*` on startup, memoise, refuse local operations
     that would violate a tuple relation. Cheap; only as strong as
     agent cooperation.
  2. **Bao Sentinel or a custom auth method** that consults
     `relationships/` before granting a write. Requires either Bao
     Enterprise or a shim.
  3. **A separate ReBAC engine** (OpenFGA, SpiceDB, Zanzibar-alike) as
     the source of truth; Bao KV becomes cache. Correct long-term shape
     at the cost of a second service.

  None of the three ships in this RFD. The tuples come first because
  storing the relationships is the small commitment that any of the
  three build on. Enforcement is a separate call and a separate RFD.
  :: details The extend flow
  Adding a new agent:

  1. Operator authorises identity (per RFD 2195 rule zero).
  2. Admin (MPS) mints cert, publishes bundle to `certs/<cn>`.
  3. **Admin writes the new agent's tuples to `relationships/`** in
     the same session, at minimum a `runs-on` tuple, plus the
     `owns` and `authors` tuples that scope the new agent's role.
  4. If a `runs-on` shares a host with an existing agent, admin
     confirms the new agent will use a per-agent-suffixed cred dir
     before completing onboarding.
  5. Agent writes its first KV row to `agents/<cn>.agents.weftspun`.

  Removing an agent (revocation):

  1. Admin revokes cert per RFD 2195's Revocation section.
  2. Admin deletes tuples where the revoked agent is `subject` (its
     claims stop being active) but preserves tuples where the revoked
     agent is `object` (so `windows-desktop hosts cuda-a63415`
     survives if we're just revoking CUDA, and the tuple gets deleted
     on the same step as CUDA's other row cleanups).
  :: details Enumerating current relationships
  Cheap `bao kv list relationships/` followed by per-tuple read:

      for k in $(bao kv list -format=json relationships/ | jq -r '.[]'); do
        bao kv get -field=subject relationships/$k
        bao kv get -field=verb    relationships/$k
        bao kv get -field=object  relationships/$k
      done

  A `list_agent_roles.py` helper would do this more efficiently
  against the API; not written today.
