rfd 2255, "an SSH tunnel to Bao for Bao-signed certificates", :committed do
  feature "A desk with no tailnet and no private-network peer reaches
Bao's listener through sshd on the Bao machine, using a
one-hour SSH certificate that Bao itself signs"
  scope "`service-openbao` (`sshd_config`, `Dockerfile.fdb`,
`entrypoint-fdb.sh`, `fly.toml`), and Bao's `ssh/` mount,
`ssh/roles/bao-tunnel` and the `ssh-bao-tunnel` policy"

  prose ~S"""
  :: decision
  The Bao machine runs sshd on port 2222. It trusts one user CA,
  the key of Bao's own `ssh/` engine, and accepts one principal,
  `tunnel`. That user has no shell and may forward only to
  `127.0.0.1:8200`. An agent signs its SSH key with its Bao token
  at `ssh/sign/bao-tunnel`, gets a certificate valid for an hour,
  and runs `ssh -N -L` to the listener. The listener's mTLS stays
  the second factor: the tunnel carries TLS, it does not replace
  it.
  :: problem
  Bao is reached over the tailnet or the private network, and a
  desk can lack both: a WSL distro is on neither, and its
  WireGuard peer fails to add its route. Every other route in
  use was an operator-held proxy, which is a person, not a path.
  :: related
  - RFD 2195 (Bao over the tailnet), the path this complements.
  - RFD 2146 (Bao is the secret store), the cert-auth identities
    that sign here.
  - RFD 2142 (Bao PKI), the root the agent certificates chain to.

  :: details Using it
  With a Bao token from cert login (RFD 2195's four variables):

      ssh-keygen -y -f key.pem > key.pub
      bao write -field=signed_key ssh/sign/bao-tunnel \
          public_key=@key.pub valid_principals=tunnel > key-cert.pub
      ssh -N -L 18200:127.0.0.1:8200 -p 2222 \
          -i key.pem -o CertificateFile=key-cert.pub tunnel@<bao address>
      export BAO_ADDR=https://127.0.0.1:18200
      export BAO_TLS_SERVER_NAME=weftspun-bao.internal

  The key can be the same P-256 key as the agent's cert-auth
  identity, converted to PKCS#8, so a desk holds one private key.
  :: details What is measured
  Run against the deployed image through a proxy to port 2222,
  and before that against a local sshd with the same config:

  | case | expected | deployed |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | Bao-signed cert, forward to 8200 | Bao answers | `cert-fedora-cad853` |
  | plain key, no certificate | refused | `Permission denied (publickey)` |
  | cert, user `root` | refused | `Permission denied (publickey)` |
  | cert, a shell command | refused | `This account is currently not available.` |
  | cert, forward to 8201 | refused | `administratively prohibited` |
  | sign for principal `root` | refused | `root is not a valid value for valid_principals` |

  The public address is IPv6 only, and it is untested from this
  desk: WSL here has no IPv6 route.
  :: details What it costs
  A redeploy restarts Bao, and Bao comes back sealed; the rollout
  that shipped this needed one unseal. The image rebuild also
  re-clones the OpenBao fork at its branch head, so a rebuild for
  sshd can change the Bao binary too. The public 8200 service is
  gone from `fly.toml`, so the only public port is 2222.

  The host key sits on the data volume and survives a redeploy.
  Its fingerprint is `SHA256:6xkNw5/8n/fRVyYU9SC0/ON+qRh+WSfVCYp8CCeuaXg`.
