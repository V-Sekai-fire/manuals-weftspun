"""Every manifest project's README.md tagline is <= 144 characters.

The tagline is the first prose paragraph, which is what a reader sees before
scrolling. A repo tagline is small on purpose: it forces the writer to pick what
the project is, not to hedge. 144 characters is the budget.

THE FIRST LINE IS NOT THE TAGLINE. This gate read it for a long time, and in 118
of 127 READMEs that line is the `# Title` heading. A title is always short, so
the gate passed on every one of them without ever reading the sentence it claims
to bound. Badge rows are skipped for the same reason: a row of shields.io links
is not a sentence either.

Silently skips projects with no README.md; reports the count so the skip does
not read as a pass (CLAUDE.md rule 3). Matches the pattern of check_anti_entropy's
existing "every README <= 40 lines" check over RFDs.
